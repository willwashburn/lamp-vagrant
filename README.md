A vagrant stack of the rackspace cloud. Great for local development.

1. Vagrant is installed
2. VirtualBox is installed

###Create Your Environment

1. Clone this repo

###Notes
the web folder is where you should clone the frontend or backend code. Eventually we'll do this with submodules, but I'm just trying to get a basic thing going here. It's a work in progress.
